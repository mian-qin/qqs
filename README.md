In order to minimize the performance impact and infrastructure cost from costly queries and link customer importance with their query performance, we need a way to allow key customers to run more queries and those who are not high-paying users but execute costly queries to run fewer queries. Also, support can also temporarily increase a customer’s query rate to address traffic spikes. Similarly, engineers can temporarily decrease a problematic customer’s query rate to minimize the negative impact on other users’ queries.
